AhMyth is a powerful open-source remote administration tool that can be used to access informational data from an android device. Through it, an attacker can access critical information such as the current geographical location of the device being attacked. In advanced use cases it can be used to hack the victim’s microphone and launch recordings, get camera snapshots and also read personal messages on the attacked device.

This tool is designed with a GUI interface which makes AhMyth one of the easiest RATs to use. With this tool, you can easily log in and gain direct control to an android device.

    AhMyth is designed solely for educational purposes. I am not in any way reponsible for any damage or 
    harm to any devices, you use this at your own risk, I also DO NOT OWN THIS PROJECT, I have just 
    contributed to it, this Android RAT application belongs to its creator AhMyth, his github

# AhMyth
As a remote administration tool, AhMyth has two parts which enable it to effectively perform its functions. 
- The server-side which acts like a desktop application that is built on an electron framework, which is used by the attacker as the control panel through which connections are made to the AhMyth software that is installed on the victim’s Android device. 

- The client-side of AhMyth works as the android application and can be used as a backdoor.
#
# How it works?
    For this tool to be used to carry an attack, the client-side must be installed on the targeted 
    Android device. Installations can be achieved by sending the target a link that contains the 
    malicious software. Upon successful installation and launch by the victim, the attacker will 
    be able to have a view of the victim’s device from the tool’s target menu. After this, the 
    attacker simply selects a favorable port from which an attack can be launched and begins 
    to listen on the targeted Android device.

    When deployed on a target device this tool can be used to access personal information such as 
    the victim’s passwords and call logs. The attacker can also gain access to the victim’s browser 
    cookies and know the web pages that have been visited using the device. Apart from allowing an 
    attacker to view the victim’s personal messages, AhMyth can also enable messages to be sent from 
    the victim’s Android device to another phone without the consent of the victim.
