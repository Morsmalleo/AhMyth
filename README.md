Any issues with AhMyth, must be posted using the *[Issue Templates](https://github.com/Morsmalleo/AhMyth/issues/new/choose)* accordingly.

The following list will help users determine which *Issue Template* is suitable for their problem.

<br>

### <div align="center"><ins>Issue Templates</ins></div>
- [x] [Server Report](https://github.com/Morsmalleo/AhMyth/issues/new?assignees=Morsmalleo&labels=bug%2C+error&template=server-report.yml&title=)

Use this *Issue Template* if you experience the following problems:
- Unstable/Unusable Victim's Lab Features
- User Interface Problems
- No Victim Connections Returning (if you're positive this issue is on the Server's side)
<br></br>

- [x] [Client Report](https://github.com/Morsmalleo/AhMyth/issues/new?assignees=Morsmalleo&labels=bug%2C+error&template=client-report.yml&title=)

Use this *Issue Template* if you experience any of the following issues on the victim's end:
- Unstable Victim Connections
- No Victim Connections Returning (if you're positive this issue is on the payload's/client's side)
- Standalone Payload Applications Crashing after Installation
- Payload Permissions not being Set for Backdoored Applications
<br></br>

- [x] [Binding Report](https://github.com/Morsmalleo/AhMyth/issues/new?assignees=Morsmalleo&labels=apktool+error%2C+server+error%2C+apktool+bug%2C+server+bug&projects=&template=binding-report.yml&title=)

Use this *Issue Template* if you experience issues backdooring an original application or after using a backdoored application.
<br></br>

- [x] [Feature Request](https://github.com/Morsmalleo/AhMyth/issues/new?assignees=Morsmalleo&labels=enhancememt&template=feature_request.yml&title=)

Use this Template if you wish to request an upgrade that hasnt already been implemented.
<br></br>

### <div align="center"><ins>Blank Issues</ins></div>
If you experience errors that arent related to any of the *Issue Templates*, or if you cant seem to fix your problem using the *Troubleshoot Manual*, then please start a *[Blank Issue](https://github.com/Morsmalleo/AhMyth/issues/new)* and post it with enough valid information about the problem.

We work hard here to keep the *Issues Section* as clean and as understanding as possible, so please help us to do that by using the *Issue Templates* or by providing non-template Issues with decent information.

Duplicate Issues will also be removed without question if I can see that the user was to lazy to check the closed issues.
