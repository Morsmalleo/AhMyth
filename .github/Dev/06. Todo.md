  <summary>In Progress.</summary>
  <br>

- [ ] Add access to a new Settings Menu tab via the click of a ⚙️ icon in the main GUI to allow users to do the following:

  - Set a Custom Output Directory for built payloads
  - Enable/Disable hardware acceleration for the AhMyth Server
> In Progress.
<br></br>
#

- [ ] Add Client Updates from [HiddenPirates](https://github.com/HiddenPirates) for Standalone Payloads.
> In Progress.
<br></br>
#

- [ ] Build a seperate API 16 to API 22 Compatible bare bones payload with no resources, values (excpet for *String.xml* containing the apps name), etc etc, for Binding to applications, this will payload will only work for Android 4.1 upto Android 5.1.
>> The SDK modification function I added for Activity based binding a while back, will allow this payload to work on SOME modern devices but not all of them, only because its a dirty workaround, and dirty workarounds while they work sometimes, they present problems other times.
